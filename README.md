# reporter-playwright-reports-server

Playwright reporter that uploads results to Playwright Reports Server - https://github.com/CyborgTests/playwright-reports-server

## Install

`npm i -D @cyborgtests/reporter-playwright-reports-server`

Then, in playwright.config file:

```js
  reporter: [
    // blob reporter is required, produced zip would be uploaded
    ['blob', { outputFile: 'test-results/blob.zip' }],
    [
      '@cyborgtests/reporter-playwright-reports-server',
      {
        // true by default. Use this if you need to skip this reporter for some cases (local executions for example)
        enable: true,
        /**
         * Your server url
         * @see https://github.com/CyborgTests/playwright-reports-server
         */
        url: 'https://your server instance.com',
        // Set token if your server instance has authentication enabled
        token: '1234'
        reportPath: 'test-results/blob.zip',
        // Any custom metadata to attach to this blob (strings)
        resultDetails: {
          branch: process.env.CI_COMMIT_BRANCH,
          foo: 'bar',
          bar: 'baz'
        },
        // Automatically trigger HTML report generation, shards supported
        triggerReportGeneration: true
      },
    ],
  ],
```

Then run your tests, if you see `[ReporterPlaywrightReportsServer] ðŸŽ­ HTML Report is available at: ...` - your blob results were successfully sent to server!

## Shards

Auto-generation of report after all shards completed is supported. But you must specify `testRun` and `triggerReportGeneration: true`:

- In reporter configuration pass

```js
resultDetails: {
  ...
  // testRun required, it should be same for all shards!
  testRun: 'my-awesome-test-run-12'
  ...
},
triggerReportGeneration: true
```

Reporter passes current shard number and total shard count to server, and after all shards uploaded - report will be generated by server for all blobs in this `testRun`
